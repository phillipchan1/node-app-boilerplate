# Node App Boilerplate
Quick launching a new node app. Built with good dev tools like nodemon and gulp.

To start developing:

1. In `/`, run `nodemon` to listen for backend changes
2. In `/public`, run `gulp` to listen for front end changes
3. Navigate to `localhost:3000` and watch the magic happen on save.
